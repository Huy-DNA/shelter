== Vault

#figure(caption: "Vault", image(width: 100pt, "../../static/vault.svg"))

=== Overview
HashiCorp Vault is a secrets management tool that securely stores and controls access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other sensitive data. It handles leasing, key revocation, key rolling, and auditing through a unified API.

=== Role in Deployment
Vault serves as the central secrets manager in our high-availability setup. It securely stores all sensitive information required by applications and infrastructure components, eliminating the need for hardcoded credentials. Its implementation addresses several critical security challenges:
- Creates a single source of truth for all secrets
- Enforces the principle of least privilege across systems
- Provides detailed audit trails for compliance requirements
- Enables automated credential rotation, reducing security risks

=== Pros
- Zero-trust security model with encryption at rest and in transit
- Dynamic secrets generation with automatic rotation
- Fine-grained access control with policy-based permissions
- Multiple authentication methods (LDAP, JWT, AWS IAM, etc.)
- Built-in audit logging and revocation capabilities

=== Basic Instructions
1. Initialize Vault server with `vault operator init`
2. Unseal the Vault using the generated unseal keys
3. Authenticate to Vault using token or authentication method
4. Configure secret engines and access policies
5. Store and retrieve secrets via CLI, API, or UI

== ZeroTier

#figure(caption: "Zerotier", image(width: 100pt, "../../static/zerotier.png"))

=== Overview
ZeroTier is a software-defined networking solution that creates secure, virtualized networks between devices regardless of physical location. It enables direct peer-to-peer connections through NAT traversal techniques.

=== Role in Deployment
ZeroTier establishes the secure networking layer for our Vault cluster. It creates a private, encrypted virtual network that spans across potentially disparate infrastructure, allowing:
- Secure communication between Vault nodes regardless of physical location
- Network isolation for the entire Vault deployment
- Simplified network topology without complex VPN configurations
- Consistent addressing scheme across different environments
- Reduced attack surface by eliminating public-facing services

=== Pros
- Software-defined networking without physical infrastructure changes
- End-to-end encryption for all traffic
- Works across different networks and NATs
- Centralized management of network access
- Low overhead and minimal configuration

=== Basic Instructions
1. Create a ZeroTier network in the central controller
2. Install ZeroTier client on each node
3. Join nodes to the network using network ID
4. Configure network permissions and routing
5. Verify connectivity between nodes

== Docker Swarm

#figure(caption: "Docker swarm", image(width: 100pt, "../../static/swarm.png"))

=== Overview
Docker Swarm is a container orchestration tool built into Docker that allows you to create and manage a cluster of Docker nodes. It provides native clustering and scheduling capabilities for Docker containers.

=== Role in Deployment
Docker Swarm orchestrates our containerized Vault deployment, providing:
- Automated service placement across the cluster for high availability
- Self-healing capabilities by restarting failed containers
- Service discovery for inter-component communication
- Simplified scaling operations as demand increases
- Consistent deployment model across different environments
- Resource allocation and constraints enforcement

=== Pros
- Integrated with Docker, requiring minimal additional tools
- Simple setup and management compared to Kubernetes
- Built-in load balancing and service discovery
- Rolling updates and health checks
- Secure by default with automatic TLS encryption

=== Basic Instructions
1. Initialize a swarm with `docker swarm init`
2. Join additional nodes as managers or workers
3. Create overlay networks for service communication
4. Deploy services using Docker Compose or stack files
5. Scale services horizontally as needed

== Prometheus

#figure(caption: "Prometheus", image(width: 100pt, "../../static/prometheus.png"))

=== Overview
Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. It collects and stores metrics as time-series data, recording real-time information about the state of systems.

=== Role in Deployment
Prometheus monitors the health and performance of our Vault cluster, providing:
- Real-time visibility into system performance and resource utilization
- Early detection of potential issues through metric collection
- Historical data for capacity planning and trend analysis
- A foundation for automated alerting on abnormal conditions
- Performance insights to optimize the infrastructure

=== Pros
- Pull-based architecture reducing network complexity
- Powerful query language (PromQL)
- Multi-dimensional data model with flexible labeling
- Built-in alerting capabilities
- Service discovery integration

=== Basic Instructions
1. Configure Prometheus server using prometheus.yml
2. Set up targets (services to monitor)
3. Define scrape intervals and retention policies
4. Configure alerting rules if needed
5. Deploy exporters for system-specific metrics collection

== Grafana

#figure(caption: "Grafana", image(width: 100pt, "../../static/grafana.jpg"))

=== Overview
Grafana is an open-source analytics and interactive visualization platform. It connects to various data sources and provides dashboards with panels representing metrics over time.

=== Role in Deployment
Grafana transforms the metrics collected by Prometheus into actionable insights through:
- Comprehensive dashboards showing system health at a glance
- Visual representation of key performance indicators
- Customizable views for different stakeholders (operators, developers, management)
- Historical performance visualization for capacity planning
- Correlation of metrics across different components of the infrastructure

=== Pros
- Rich visualization options and dashboard templates
- Multi-data source support
- Shareable, reusable dashboards
- Alerting capabilities with multiple notification channels
- Extensible with plugins and data source integrations

=== Basic Instructions
1. Install and configure Grafana server
2. Add Prometheus as a data source
3. Create or import dashboards
4. Configure panels to display relevant metrics
5. Set up alerting based on visualization thresholds

== NGINX

#figure(caption: "NGINX", image(width: 100pt, "../../static/nginx.svg"))

=== Overview
NGINX is a high-performance web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer. It efficiently handles connections, providing robust HTTP/HTTPS services with minimal resource usage.

=== Role in Deployment
NGINX serves as the entry point and load balancer for our Vault deployment:
- Distributes client requests across multiple Vault instances
- Provides SSL/TLS termination to offload encryption overhead
- Acts as a security barrier between external networks and Vault
- Enables seamless scaling by abstracting backend changes
- Implements circuit breaking and health checks to enhance reliability
- Provides a consistent entry point regardless of backend changes

=== Pros
- High performance with low resource utilization
- Advanced load balancing algorithms
- SSL/TLS termination and optimization
- Caching capabilities for improved response times
- Extensive configuration options and flexibility
