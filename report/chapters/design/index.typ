== Monitoring Objectives
The goal of the monitoring system is to ensure the high availability and operational health of the Vault deployment. Prometheus collects metrics from all Vault nodes and related services, allowing operators to:
- Detect unseal or cluster issues
- Monitor request rates and token creation
- Track system resource usage (CPU, RAM, Disk)
- Provide data visualization and alerts
